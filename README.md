# Boilerplate Website
Semin√°rios III (2021) - Workshop 2 - React

The website is available [here](https://rhian-cs.github.io/puc-2021-1-seminarios-3-oficina-2-boilerplate-project/public/index.html).

## Description
This project is the first part of the course, focusing on creating some boilerplate and a simple website to learn the basics.
What it basically does is show 6 polaroids with random images and random dummy text (lorem ipsum).

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the application. I also state the versions I used, but older versions will most likely work fine too.

- Install the JavaScript dependencies with `yarn install`
